# FoundKey
FoundKey is a free and open source microblogging server compatible with ActivityPub.
It is currently under **LIMITED MAINTENANCE** and is not well suited for large instances.
No more than 20 users per instance are recommended.

Forked from Misskey, FoundKey improves on maintainability and behaviour, while also bringing in useful features.

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for more on what's changed and future plans.
